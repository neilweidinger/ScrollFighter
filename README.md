# ScrollFighter
A Chrome extension to combat procrastination by telling you how far you've scrolled in inches. Set a limit for how much you can scroll on a specific website, and get "KO'd" when you go over your daily limit. Featuring cheeky notifications and a Street Fighter animation when you get close to your limit. (Disclaimer: not a serious project, and my first time using javascript for a project so definitely not the most robust code)
